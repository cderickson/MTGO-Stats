# MTGO-Tracker
MTGO-Tracker is an analytics tool used to process raw data for Magic: the Gathering Online. Players can import and parse log files created during online play and store resulting information into a local database for self-analysis.

Five (5) tables are created: 
* Matches
* Games
* Plays
* Drafts
* Draft Picks

These tables will help you not only track and analyze your results, but your play patterns as well.
