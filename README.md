# MTGO-Tracker
MTGO-Tracker will break down your play history on Magic Online into a personal database. It will help you format your data for further statistical analysis, or allow you to simply use the built-in descriptive statistics.

Five (5) tables are created: **Matches, Games, Plays, Drafts, Draft Picks**. These tables will help you not only track and analyze your results, but your play patterns as well.

<summary><b>Exporting Tables (Inverse Joined)</b></summary>

	- The Inverse Join table creates a second row for each Match/Game with P1 and P2 reversed.
	- This allows filtering on either the P1 or P2 columns to display all games involving a specific player.
	- Keep in mind the tables exported with this option will be twice as large.
