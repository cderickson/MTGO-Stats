# MTGO-Tracker
MTGO-Tracker will break down your play history on Magic Online into a personal database. It will help you format your data for further statistical analysis, or allow you to simply use the built-in descriptive statistics.

Five (5) tables are created: 
* Matches
* Games
* Plays
* Drafts
* Draft Picks

These tables will help you not only track and analyze your results, but your play patterns as well.
